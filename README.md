# Smart-Contract

**This smart contract was written in Solidity. Unfamiliar with Solidity? Here's some helpful information from their documentation:** 

>Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. 
>Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
>Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
>It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript. 
>Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

**This was my first smart contract. It is minimal/basic, yet afforded me the opportunity to understand (high level) smart contracts end to end by constructing, refactoring, compiling, and deploying one.** 

\
\
**Original Contract**
Smart Contract written in Solidity was complied, debugged, and deployed (ran transactions)through Remix local IDE
